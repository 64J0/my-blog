Some people claim that knowing how to tame and properly orchestrate a group of different "AI" processes is the most useful skill a software engineer can have for the future. In fact, this is aligned with the idea that in the future all the software development is going to be handled by those "AI" processes.

However, it's rather easy to spot the problem with this theory.

In a world where "AI" processes are so powerful that they can manage the software development almost autonomously, why would you think that there will not be an "AI" process itself that is going to be able to tame and eventually orchestrate other "AI" processes?

Therefore, this operational knowledge would be as useless as anything software development related, given the bold assumption that software engineering will be obsolete.

Perhaps, having this operational knowledge today makes sense, and will keep being valuable in the short term, although it's not perfect and magic.

Instead, a safer bet seems to be to focus on fundamentals.
