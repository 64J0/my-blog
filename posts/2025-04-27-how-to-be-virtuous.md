When you start studying the Greek classic philosophers it may become evident
that a side-effect of their seek for the "Objective Truth" is to answer the most
important questions of a human life. For example, what is knowledge, what is the
goal of life, what is a good life, what are virtues, etc.

And it's impressive to realize that they were able to reach rational and based
answers for most of those questions.

Well, for this article I'm going to present Aristotle's take on how to be
virtuous.

But first, we need to know how one **learns** to be virtuous. And the answer is
by studying what virtuous people did in the past. While doing this, you'll
notice that virtue lies in the middle of two vices, and that it depends on the
actual circumstances.

This idea is related to Plato's aristocratic education.

Furthermore, it's not sufficient to just know what virtuous people did in the
past, one needs to put it into **practice consciously**, with the right and
aligned spirit.

Aristotle's take is that being virtuous is similar to being strong. To be strong
you need to exercise your muscles (conscious practice), but just exercising is
not sufficient, you need to feed your body with the right nutrients (study what
virtuous people did in the past), and have the necessary rest (reflection).

Finally, as noted before, virtue lies in the middle of two radical vices. But
how can we know where this middle is?

Well, there are some directives you can consider before jumping into action:

1. Avoid the extremes, especially the most serious errors. In some scenarios,
   one of the extremes is more serious than the other. *But be aware that
   extremes avoidance is the error itself for some circumstances (example:
   [Sobre o relativismo
   moral](https://gaio.dev/posts/2024-06-18-sobre-o-relativismo-moral)).*
2. Take into account the errors you're especially more prone to (different
   people are more inclined to different kind of errors, what is your personal
   inclination?). Then, we must drag ourselves away, in the opposite direction,
   for by steering wide of our besetting error we shall make a middle course.
3. Be in guard against what is purely pleasant!
4. If it's possible, simulate by considering the radical scenarios first, then
   it may be more clear what the middle course looks like.
